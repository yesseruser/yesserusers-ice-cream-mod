# yesseruser's Ice Cream Mod

A simple ice cream mod. Adds multiple ice creams that can be crafted and eaten.  
Some of them have positive or negative effects, so watch out...

This is the successor to the original [Yesseruser's Ice Cream Mod](https://mcreator.net/modification/67926/yesserusers-ice-cream-mod)
made with MCreator. This version is, however, made the classic way (with Java) for Forge.

## Development

To build and test the mod, you need IntelliJ IDEA with the [Minecraft Development](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8327-minecraft-development) mod installed.
Community edition works. The [Architectury](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16210-architectury) plugin is also recommended.  
Clone the repository, then open the directory with IntelliJ IDEA. It will then load the gradle project and generate build configurations. 
Depending on your internet speed, this may take 5-15 minutes if Gradle wasn't downloaded before.

To run the mod, use the generated Minecraft Client (:loader) configuration with the loader of your choice.
